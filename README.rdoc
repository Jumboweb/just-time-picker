= Introduction

This is a simple gem for {Active Admin}[http://www.activeadmin.info] that just 
adds support for Time picker.

It supports both ActiveRecord for relational databases and {Mongoid}[http://www.mongoid.org] 
for {MongoDB}[http://www.mongodb.org] schemaless database.

For Date/Time picker widget, see {just-datetime-picker}[https://github.com/saepia/just-datetime-picker].

= Usage

== Code samples

Here comes a quick code sample. Sorry, currently no detailed docs.

That should create nice date/time picker for User#notify_at. 

Associated column in the DB should can have type of :time. It has to be nullable.

To delete previously stored time just make all fields blank (hour and minute).

=== Migration (if you use ActiveRecord)

  class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def change
      create_table :users do |t|
        t.time  :notify_at # You can also use :integer with :limit => 6

        t.timestamps
      end

    end
  end

=== Model

==== ActiveRecord

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    just_define_time_picker :notify_at, :add_to_attr_accessible => true
    validates :notify_at, :presence => true
  end

==== Mongoid

  class User
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :notify_at, type: Time
    just_define_time_picker :notify_at, :add_to_attr_accessible => true
  end
  
You must place "mongoid" gem BEFORE "just-time-picker" gem in your Gemfile!

=== ActiveAdmin

  ActiveAdmin.register User do
    form do |f|
      f.inputs do
        f.input :notify_at, :as => :just_time_picker
      end

      f.buttons
    end
  end
